## Introduction

### Challenges

- Complex systems
- Interaction between components
- Creativity of attackers
- Security vs. Usabillity

### Security

.. is a situation, where the risk is smaller than the risk-tolerance (Grenzrisiko).


- Risk = damage * probability
- Security goals: CIA-Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

### Categories

#### Unallowed Access
- Sniffing
- Man in the middle

#### Deception
- Spoofing
- Man in the middle

#### Functionality Interruption
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

#### Unallowed Usage
- Command Injection

### Attacking Steps
1. Collecting information
2. Exploiting security problems
3. Using the access
4. Hiding steps

### Risk Analysis

..contains:

- Thread groups (target, source, motivation, probability, costs)
- Threads
- Risk analysis/evaluation
- Actions
- Estimation of rest risk
